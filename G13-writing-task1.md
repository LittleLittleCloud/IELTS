> You work for an international company, and would like to spend six months
working in its head office in another country.
Write a letter to your manager. In your letter
• explain why you want to work in the company's head office for six months
• say how your work could be done while you are away
• ask for his/her help in arranging it 

Dear manager

I'm writing this letter to ask your permission to work in our head office in US for six months. One team in head office is quite interested in a component I'm working on, and they want to have me help them to integrate that component into their product. The workload will be around six months. Personally I also want to go because it's a good oppotunity to increase my impact across the company.

In the meantime, I can still finish my work while I'm away. Firstly, as there's no time zone between Vancouver and Seattle, I can still attend all the meeting through Internet. Secondly, their manager says I will still have enough bandwidth on other work as they have enough developers on that project. So you don't need to worry that my leave will affect the progress on our project.

Finally, it would be great if you can approve and arrange it. As it is a good change to me, I sincerely hope you can allow it.

Regards
